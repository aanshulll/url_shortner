# ðŸ”— URL Shortener

This is a simple URL shortener app I built using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS**.  
The idea is straightforward â€“ paste a long link, and youâ€™ll get a short, shareable one back.  
It also tracks visits so you can see when your links are being used.

## âœ¨ What it can do
- Turn long, messy URLs into short ones
- Redirect short URLs to the original site
- Keep track of visits with timestamps
- Clean and minimal UI (EJS templates)
- Stores everything in MongoDB

## ðŸ›  Tech Used
- Backend: **Node.js + Express**
- Frontend: **EJS, HTML, CSS**
- Database: **MongoDB (Mongoose)**
- Config: **dotenv**
